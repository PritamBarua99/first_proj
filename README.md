**About**

This modular project demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow: data loading, model training/tuning, evaluation, and model saving. We used two popular regressors (Linear Regression and Random Forest). 
Hyperparameters for the Random Forest were tuned via RandomizedSearchCV. We visualized feature importances (since Random Forest provides them) and plotted residuals to check fit. 
Finally, the trained model is saved as a .pkl file for deployment or later use.
